First, I am creating my web template using Canvas 
My second step is now to use the template I created on Canvas to help me get more stuff into the index.html. I started with HTML syntax, which made it much easier to see my progress and understand where I was heading.
Rather than using the specific method, I considered using a more general approach.

I got stuck on challenges that tested my patience and persistence. At first, I struggled with getting the background image to display correctly without leaving white spaces at the corners.

 Another hurdle was making the layout responsive, so it would look good both on my laptop and on mobile devices.

I also found animations tricky â€” sometimes they wouldnâ€™t trigger the way I expected, and I had to spend time understanding how CSS transitions and keyframes really work. Linking multiple pages together smoothly was another small, but important, step that taught me a lot about project structure and navigation.

Even with these struggles, each mistake helped me learn more about HTML and CSS. This site is not just a project, but also a reflection of my growth and determination as a frontend student.

 My Learning Journey â€“ Frontend Portfolio




 #  My Learning Journey â€“ Frontend Portfolio

## What I Learned
- **HTML Structure** â†’ How to organize content into sections (header, hero, skills, achievements, footer).  
- **CSS Styling** â†’ Using flexbox, margins, padding, and text alignment to design a clean layout.  
- **Responsive Design** â†’ Making the site adapt to both laptop and mobile screens with media queries.  
- **Backgrounds** â†’ Using `background-size: cover` to make sure the image fills the page.  
- **Animations** â†’ Creating hover effects and slide-in transitions with CSS keyframes.  
- **Navigation** â†’ Linking multiple pages together for a smooth experience.  

## ðŸ”§ Problems I Faced & How I Solved Them
1. **Background image not showing**  
   - Issue: The background was either cropped incorrectly or left white spaces.  
   - Solution: Learned the difference between `contain` and `cover`, then used `cover` for a perfect fullscreen look.  

2. **Animations not working**  
   - Issue: My icons didnâ€™t animate at first.  
   - Solution: Realized I forgot to define `@keyframes` correctly and apply `:hover` states.  

3. **Page not mobile-friendly**  
   - Issue: Content overlapped on small screens.  
   - Solution: Used **flexbox** and **media queries** to adjust layout for mobile.  

4. **Navigation links**  
   - Issue: Clicking my links didnâ€™t lead to the right page.  
   - Solution: Fixed file naming (`.html` consistency) and folder structure.  

5. **Image rendering issues**  
   - Issue: Profile and background images werenâ€™t appearing.  
   - Solution: Renamed files carefully (case-sensitive: `Sarge.jpg` â‰  `sarge.jpg`) and placed them in the correct folder.

    **Reflection**  
This project taught me that building websites isnâ€™t only about writing code â€” itâ€™s about solving problems step by step. Each struggle made me more confident with HTML and CSS, and I now feel better prepared for future projects.
